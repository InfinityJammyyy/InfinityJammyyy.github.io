    <p style="width: 1000px;">With Chicago95 you can install a windows95 like
      theme on XUbuntu this does work with other Distros but I have found that
      XUbuntu coming pre-packaged with the XFCE desktop environment is the works
      the best.</p>
    <p style="width: 1000px;">To install the theme you need the Chicago95 GitHub
      cloned to your system and you need python to make it so that windows 95/98
      applications can be installed on your system you need Wine32 and Solitaire
      98 can simply be found on the Internet Archive now that we have the
      prerequisites out of the way lets get into installing the system and
      configuring the desktop.</p>
    <p>This is what the desktop looks like with Chicago95.</p>

    <p>Now lets begin the installation process for installing this nice theme.</p>
    <p>ps tldr if you know how to install xubuntu skip to step 6</p>
    <p>1.) Head down to xubuntu.org head to downloads and click 64-bit systems
      this will give you a torrent file for xubuntu in the x86-64 architecture
      (you are most likely architecture you are using on your laptop/pc unless
      you use macbooks) </p>
    <p>2.) Install qbittorrent on your device and launch the application in the
      top left corner you will see files click it and select add torrent file
      then it should bring up your file explorer head to your downloads and you
      should see your torrent file click it it will take you to a screen were
      you can configure were it is downloaded and other stuff however by default
      it will install to your downloads directory so you can just hit Ok which
      is in the bottom right corner</p>
    <p>3.) Once it finishes downloading (you should get a notification) flash it
      to your USB stick using balcena etcher or gnome disks or any of your
      favorite flashing software </p>
    <p>4.) First you need to go into your BIOS by either pressing f2 or f12 at
      boot (mine is f2)&nbsp; (if you open the menu to boot from external media
      you can just shutdown your computer and press the other button) and
      disable secure boot and enable legacy booting as well as enabling booting
      from USB then save and exit next boot from your USB stick on your computer
      usually to do this you need to spam f2 or f12 it depends from computer to
      computer (mine is f12) you should see your USB BOOT or something similar
      click that remember do not click the UEFI option to boot as that will
      break things</p>
    <p>5.) Go through the normal install process and install xubuntu</p>
    <p>6.) Hi if you skipped! Welcome to your new desktop now run:</p>
    <p>yes | sudo apt update &amp;&amp; yes | sudo apt upgrade</p>
    <p>this will fully update and upgrade your system without any user
      interaction!</p>
      <p>lets install the dependencies needed for our theme install python, git,
      and for compatibility with windows 95 applications install wine and wine32
      for the browser you can use palemoon. To install the packages listed above
      simply run:</p>
    <p>sudo apt install &lt;Package goes here&gt; </p>
    <p>7.) Configure the wine compatibility layer if you did not install wine
      skip to step 8 anyway open a terminal and run</p>
      <p>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386</p> 
      <p>this enables the 32 bit architecture required for running Windows 95/98 applications now run winecfg once it is finished simply hit Ok
      no additional configuration is required</p>
    <p>8.) Open the terminal and type:</p>
    <p>git clone https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95</p>
    <p>make sure to go to that GitHub repository to check it you should not git
      clone anything without checking it first as people like me could clone
      malware onto your system just as a warning anyway open up the folder that
      it installed onto your system then right click and hit open terminal here
      next run:</p>
    <p>python3 installer.py</p>
    <p>this will open up the installer just install what you want using the
      check boxes (I recommend installing them all) </p>
    <p>9.) Enjoy Chicago95 and if you want to install solitaire 98 you can find
      it here:</p>
    <p>https://archive.org/details/solitaire_202102</p>
    <p>simply double click the EXE file</p>
