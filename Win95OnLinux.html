    <h1 style=" width: 1400px;">Windows 95 on Linux with Chicago95, Wine32, and
      Solitaire 98.</h1>
    <p>With Chicago95 you can install a windows95 like theme on XUbuntu this
      does work with other Distros but I have found that XUbuntu coming
      pre-packaged with the XFCE desktop environment is the works the best.</p>
    <p>To install the theme you need the Chicago95 GitHub cloned to your system
      and you need python to make it so that windows 95/98 applications can be
      installed on your system you need Wine32 and Solitaire 98 can simply be
      found on the Internet Archive now that we have the prerequisites out of
      the way lets get into installing the system and configuring the desktop.</p>
    <p>This is what the desktop looks like with Chicago95.</p>
